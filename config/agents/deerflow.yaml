# Deer-flow Agent Profiles Configuration
# 
# Similar structure to config/agents/langchain.yaml but for Deer-flow agent profiles.
# Each profile defines a Deer-flow agent configuration with specific tool groups,
# MCP servers, and optional GenAI Blueprint tool injections.
#
# Key fields:
#   name:              Profile display name
#   tool_groups:       Deer-flow tool groups to enable (web, file:read, file:write, bash)
#   subagent_enabled:  Enable subagent orchestration (parallel task delegation)
#   thinking_enabled:  Enable thinking/reasoning mode (model-dependent)
#   mcp_servers:       MCP server names from config/mcp_servers.yaml
#   tools:             Additional GenAI Blueprint tools (factory/class/function patterns)
#   system_prompt:     Optional custom system prompt (appended to Deer-flow's built-in prompt)
#   examples:          Sample queries for the demo UI
